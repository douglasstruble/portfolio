						<p>I was traveling on a train when another commuter suddenly bursts out laughing. Several people looked up with a grin at the laughing commuter and then went back to their screens. From my observation most commuters were using their smart phones doing one of three things: texting, gaming or reading/scrolling content. I wondered how a mobile chat game could connect all those commuters with laughter. </p>

  <p>From this I derived a simple game of humor tag. A player sends a joke to a stranger or friend without the punch line. If the receiver wants to know the punch line they must send a joke back to reveal the complete joke. All jokes received would go into a player's database so that they could be retold again. Players can write jokes and share them. Users can set filters on the type of humor they want. This simple idea became the impulse for building Punch Line. </p>

						<p>Who is a gamer? Why do we play mobile games? What games do we play? To answer these questions I created a survey and posted it on Reddit and interviewed five self identifying gamers. Here is what I learned:</p>
						<p>MOTIVATIONS <li> Users would often play games when they were waiting or alone. <li> Using a chat feature was a common socialization tool of gamers during play. <li>Social circle of friends would gather to play games. <li>Being known as a funny person was a social plus.<li> A majority of female gamers surveyed preferred enjoyed puzzle type games.</p>
						<p>FRUSTRATIONS <br> <li> Players being penalized for not responding immediately during play. <li>Players had difficulty remembering good jokes. <li>Players rarely shared jokes while texting. <li>Funny introverts had few opportunities to share their jokes <li>Being a gamer was often associated with socially awkward, introverted behavior.<li> Games needed to accommodate playing game in short spurts.</p>
						<p>CONSIDERATIONS <br> <li>Research data found in the User Persona's followed the Bartle's player categorization. <li>There are currently no competitive joke telling mobile games.</p>

						<p>The language of comedy has a violent vocabulary. You throw punch lines; you kill the audience, you bombed, slap stick, etc. The simple act of telling jokes is both exhilarating and brutal if met with dramatic silence. For these reasons, the game’s look and feel is based on the display iconography of boxing posters linking laughter with the excitement of the big fight.</p>
                        <p> The basic color scheme of black red and yellow blatantly mimics the easily recognizable propaganda style found in the boxing posters. The logo font of Fjalla with its lean and mean stature and tall and sharp san serif corners says authority. While the solid and strong Future Condensed font states it purpose clearly in headings. Last by not least Avenir easy and crisply communicates any text content. </p>

						<p>I was anxious to translate my notes and research into a working prototype so I could begin testing and refining the app. I built and tested numerous Sketch prototypes using INvision. I transformed barebones sketches into a clickable prototype through rounds of exploring visual design, conducting usability testing, and iterating on user feedback. I also developed an on boarding tutorial that outlined a 3 step process to easy game play.</p>

				 <p>My first low fidelity prototype focused primarily on the mechanics of game play. I tried a swiping gesture which mimicked throwing a punch and content drawers because they worked well to accommodated small screens. </p> 
                  
                        <p>READY - INBOX<br> Inbox of new jokes (in red) are choosen to respond or block. </p>
                        
                        <p>AIM - SEARCH/SORT<br> The user swipes left to reveal their joke database to choose a joke. Swiping left again reveals the database filter. </p>
                        
                        <p>FIRE - SEND<br> The user chooses a joke and taps it to send the joke.</p>
                        
                        <p>I built an inital prototype and conducted three user tests that were done over the phone and using live share with Invision. From my testing I learned that UI patterns using swiping gesture and drawers were associated with browsing content. User wanted a simple large button to send jokes not a gesture and were overwhelmed with an inbox of jokes. Most users wanted a one on one chat like boxing match. The most valued functions were searching and writing jokes and finding opponents.</p>

				 <p>Next, I tested a new prototype with three new users and the first three users. In this prototype, I fundamentally changed the UI by dividing the screen into two parts where each boxer takes a corner. The player avatar in the upper right corner and the opponent in the lower left. The top screen displayed the joke database with search/sort and writing (+) functions. The bottom screen the list of matches (inbox) and boxing ring (chat arena) with a large VS. button for starting a new fights. From my second round of testing I learned that new players wanted to quickly begin playing and so I included two complimentary jokes to facilitate engagement and introduce users to how the game is scored.

From my user testing, I learned that thumbs are the masters of the game universe. So I accommodated those thumb wars and turned the screen horizontal. I also learned swiping is associated with browsing so in this version the user sorts and searches jokes by swiping. </p>

<p>The duality of the split screen was way to confusing of users. So instead of reinventing the wheel, I adopted the standard UI patterns for chat apps and how users send a gifs or emoji.  </p>

<p>My study of gamification techniques greatly influenced this prototype. A more prominent score, leader boards, 12 round matches and time limits that influence scoring. Incentivizing starting fight by giving a point advantage. Overall, I focused on making the game fun and competitive without to many rules.</p>

						<p>Punch Line is a humorous thumb war. Turning the screen to accommodate the users thumbs made all the difference in creating a intuitive and fun gaming experience. Learning about gamification and the gamer psychology was fascinating. I also really enjoyed the passion of the "gamers" I interviewed and who tested my prototype. </p>

                        <p>Translating the idea of the game into a clear user interface was challenging. Done in solitude it felt like untangling a web. But with patience and applying the design thinking process (Empathize – Define – Ideate – Prototype - Test – Implement) I soon got a clear picture of the UI, and once I could see it, I could make it. Because my first profession was graphic design, my largest lesson was staying low fidelity for as long as possible. Design is a waist of time at the wire frame and lo fidelity level. Now I know!</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>User testing involves one of my favorite things, asking questions. And the insights from user testing were no less than revolutionary in clarifying user patterns and orienting the game. Through out this project, I have been amazed at the amount of enthusiasm Punch Line has inspired in others. After posting this project on Slack, I received lots of positive feed back and recently have been working with developers on building a working actionable game! I am very excited and look forward to sharing this once it is finished.</p>

						<p>Heartwood Educational Collaborative provides several inspired, Waldorf Education tailored programs and resources to meet the developmental needs of students who are homeschooled or campus attendees. Under new leadership the school needed a remake of their website within a month. The majority of the research was captured over two meeting with the stakeholders and summarized in a project brief. Though this was not optimal for collecting a broad picture of the school’s clients it quickly became apparent that the highly specialized niche that Waldorf homeschools occupy in the San Francisco Bay Area bought a ready audience and simplified the goals of the site. The client provided a mood board, a sitemap and a Dropbox full of images.</p>

It became obvious after out initial meeting that the client’s vision of the project scope was too large for the current deadline and budget.</p>

<p>SOLUTION  <br>
Using the data from the project brief we narrowed the functionality of the website into a list of “must haves” and aligned current functionality into a minimum viable product. The new project scope incorporated consolidating the calendar, linking to existing online donation methods and simplifying the online application form.</p>

						<p>PROBLEM
                            <br>
The current site map did not provide consistent site hierarchy as characterized by the goals outlined in the project brief. In addition, the site page outline had vital information buried, and a lack of clear information architecture.</p>

<p>SOLUTION <br>
                            
Working with the school administrator, we edited the site map and consolidated content to meet the end goals of different users. By identifying the end goals of the users, a vital missing part of the initial persona sketches, the content structure and site navigation changed entirely. The site was divided up into three distinct content driven sections.</p>

					<p>Ok, I am a generalist I admit it. I like to wear lots of hats.</p>
					<p>As a Waldorf teacher I taught language arts, math, history, art, science, woodshop, technology, geography, movement, drama & science , so there’s that. </p>
					<p>Prior to teaching, I was a graphic designer for ten years. Behind the screen, I learned the dark arts of marketing and stories of the brand. Yet my fascination with people, cognitive studies and a desire for a better world brought me to teaching and ironically has brought me full circle to UX design. Home at last! </p>
				
					<p>Today, I have just begun my UX design career. I come with a deep set of soft skills developed as an educator, paired with ten-year experience as a graphic designer in marketing and brand strategy, So take a look at my work, and let me know if you like what you see. </p>
					<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
