					<p>Ok, I am a generalist I admit it. I like to wear lots of hats.</p>
					<p>As a Waldorf teacher I taught language arts, math, history, art, science, woodshop, technology, geography, movement, drama &science , so there’s that. </p>
					<p>Prior to teaching, I was a graphic designer for ten years. Behind the screen, I learned the dark arts of marketing and stories of the brand. Yet my fascination with people, cognitive studies and a desire for a better world brought me to teaching and ironically has brought me full circle to UX design. Home at last! </p>
					<p>One of my little joys in life is lateral thinking maybe because I love asking just the right question. </p>
					<p>Regardless, any work that involves thinking out of the box, recognizing patterns and playing the investigative journalist sound like fun. </p>
					<p>So for me, the UX research &analysis phase is truly eating desert first. </p>
					<p>Making and testing lo-Fi interactive wireframes and prototypes is my authentication playground. During this phase my strong intuition and diagnostic skills help create a product that is more than just the sum of it parts. Then there’s that true love of mine, design. Better yet sharing and testing that design and watching it improve. </p>
					<p>Here at the intersection between people and design is the spark that continues to inspire my work as a UX designer. </p>
					<p>Today, I have just begun my UX design career. I come with a deep set of soft skills developed as an educator, paired with ten-year experience as a graphic designer in marketing and brand strategy, So take a look at my work, and let me know if you like what you see. </p>
					<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

						<p>Who is a gamer? Why do we play mobile games? What games do we play? To answer these questions I created a survey and posted it on Reddit and interviewed five gamers. Here is what I learned:</p>
						<p>MOTIVATIONS Users would often play games when they were waiting or alone Using a chat feature was a common socialization tool of gamers during play. Social circle of friends would gather to play games. Being known as a funny person was a social plus. A majority of female gamers especially enjoyed puzzle type games.</p>
						<p>FRUSTRATIONS Players being penalized for not responding immediately during play Players had difficulty remembering good jokes. Players rarely shared jokes while texting. Funny introverts had few opportunities to share their jokes Being a gamer was often associated with socially awkward, introverted behavior Games needed to accommodate playing game in short spurts.</p>
						<p>CONSIDERATIONS There are curretly no competive joke telling mobile games My research reflected Richard Bartle prevalent player categorization models.</p>
