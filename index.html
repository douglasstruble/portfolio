                    <p>I was traveling on a train when another commuter suddenly bursts out laughing. Several people looked up with a grin at the laughing commuter and then went back to their screens. From my observation most commuters were using their smart phones doing one of three things: texting, gaming or reading/scrolling content. I wondered how a mobile chat game could connect all those commuters with laughter. </p>

                    <p>From this I derived a simple game of humor tag. A player sends a joke to a stranger or friend without the punch line. If the receiver wants to know the punch line they must send a joke back to reveal the complete joke. All jokes received would go into a player's database so that they could be retold again. Players can write jokes and share them. Users can set filters on the type of humor they want. This simple idea became the impulse for building Punch Line. </p>

                    <p>Who is a gamer? Why do we play mobile games? What games do we play? To answer these questions I created a survey and posted it on Reddit and interviewed five self identifying gamers. Here is what I learned:</p>
                    <p>MOTIVATIONS
                        <li> Users would often play games when they were waiting or alone.
                            <li> Using a chat feature was a common socialization tool of gamers during play.
                                <li>Social circle of friends would gather to play games.
                                    <li>Being known as a funny person was a social plus.
                                        <li> A majority of female gamers surveyed preferred enjoyed puzzle type games.</p>
                    <p>FRUSTRATIONS <br>
                        <li> Players being penalized for not responding immediately during play.
                            <li>Players had difficulty remembering good jokes.
                                <li>Players rarely shared jokes while texting.
                                    <li>Funny introverts had few opportunities to share their jokes
                                        <li>Being a gamer was often associated with socially awkward, introverted behavior.
                                            <li> Games needed to accommodate playing game in short spurts.</p>
                    <p>CONSIDERATIONS <br>
                        <li>Research data found in the User Persona's followed the Bartle's player categorization.
                            <li>There are currently no competitive joke telling mobile games.</p>

                    <p>The language of comedy has a violent vocabulary. You throw punch lines; you kill the audience, you bombed, slap stick, etc. The simple act of telling jokes is both exhilarating and brutal if met with dramatic silence. For these reasons, the game’s look and feel is based on the display iconography of boxing posters linking laughter with the excitement of the big fight.</p>
                    <p> The basic color scheme of black red and yellow blatantly mimics the easily recognizable propaganda style found in the boxing posters. The logo font of Fjalla with its lean and mean stature and tall and sharp san serif corners says authority. While the solid and strong Future Condensed font states it purpose clearly in headings. Last by not least Avenir easy and crisply communicates any text content. </p>

                    <p>I was anxious to translate my notes and research into a working prototype so I could begin testing and refining the app. I built and tested numerous Sketch prototypes using INvision. I transformed barebones sketches into a clickable prototype through rounds of exploring visual design, conducting usability testing, and iterating on user feedback. I also developed an on boarding tutorial that outlined a 3 step process to easy game play.</p>

                    <p>My first low fidelity prototype focused primarily on the mechanics of game play. I tried a swiping gesture which mimicked throwing a punch and content drawers because they worked well to accommodated small screens. </p>

                    <p>READY - INBOX<br> Inbox of new jokes (in red) are choosen to respond or block. </p>

                    <p>AIM - SEARCH/SORT<br> The user swipes left to reveal their joke database to choose a joke. Swiping left again reveals the database filter. </p>

                    <p>FIRE - SEND<br> The user chooses a joke and taps it to send the joke.</p>

                    <p>I built an inital prototype and conducted three user tests that were done over the phone and using live share with Invision. From my testing I learned that UI patterns using swiping gesture and drawers were associated with browsing content. User wanted a simple large button to send jokes not a gesture and were overwhelmed with an inbox of jokes. Most users wanted a one on one chat like boxing match. The most valued functions were searching and writing jokes and finding opponents.</p>

                    <p>Next, I tested a new prototype with three new users and the first three users. In this prototype, I fundamentally changed the UI by dividing the screen into two parts where each boxer takes a corner. The player avatar in the upper right corner and the opponent in the lower left. The top screen displayed the joke database with search/sort and writing (+) functions. The bottom screen the list of matches (inbox) and boxing ring (chat arena) with a large VS. button for starting a new fights. From my second round of testing I learned that new players wanted to quickly begin playing and so I included two complimentary jokes to facilitate engagement and introduce users to how the game is scored.

                        From my user testing, I learned that thumbs are the masters of the game universe. So I accommodated those thumb wars and turned the screen horizontal. I also learned swiping is associated with browsing so in this version the user sorts and searches jokes by swiping. </p>

                    <p>The duality of the split screen was way to confusing of users. So instead of reinventing the wheel, I adopted the standard UI patterns for chat apps and how users send a gifs or emoji. </p>

                    <p>My study of gamification techniques greatly influenced this prototype. A more prominent score, leader boards, 12 round matches and time limits that influence scoring. Incentivizing starting fight by giving a point advantage. Overall, I focused on making the game fun and competitive without to many rules.</p>

                    <p>Punch Line is a humorous thumb war. Turning the screen to accommodate the users thumbs made all the difference in creating a intuitive and fun gaming experience. Learning about gamification and the gamer psychology was fascinating. I also really enjoyed the passion of the "gamers" I interviewed and who tested my prototype. </p>

                    <p>Translating the idea of the game into a clear user interface was challenging. Done in solitude it felt like untangling a web. But with patience and applying the design thinking process (Empathize – Define – Ideate – Prototype - Test – Implement) I soon got a clear picture of the UI, and once I could see it, I could make it. Because my first profession was graphic design, my largest lesson was staying low fidelity for as long as possible. Design is a waist of time at the wire frame and lo fidelity level. Now I know!</p>


                    <p>User testing involves one of my favorite things, asking questions. And the insights from user testing were no less than revolutionary in clarifying user patterns and orienting the game. Through out this project, I have been amazed at the amount of enthusiasm Punch Line has inspired in others. After posting this project on Slack, I received lots of positive feed back and recently have been working with developers on building a working actionable game! I am very excited and look forward to sharing this once it is finished.</p>

Under new leadership the school needed a remake of their website within a month. The majority of the research was captured over two meeting with the stakeholders and summarized in a project brief. Though this was not optimal for collecting a broad picture of the school’s clients it quickly became apparent that the highly specialized niche that Waldorf homeschools occupy in the San Francisco Bay Area bought a ready audience and simplified the goals of the site. The client provided a mood board, a sitemap and a Dropbox full of images.</p>

                    <p> Review of the websites tasks with Google analytics and feedback from the office staff about callers who had visited the website showed the importance of free quality resource and blog articles driving conversion. It also revealed that the current admission process was not clear. Futher discussion about the mission and history of the school assisted the rebranding of the school and revealed a competitive advantage created by impacted enrollment at other local charter schools.</p>

                        <br> It became obvious after out initial meeting that the client’s vision of the project scope was too large for the current deadline and budget.</p>

                    <p>SOLUTION <br> Using the data from the project brief we narrowed the functionality of the website into a list of “must haves” and aligned current functionality into a minimum viable product. The new project scope incorporated consolidating the calendar, linking to existing online donation methods and simplifying the online application form.</p>

                    <p>From the onset of this project the stakeholders had a clear vision of their brand story and mission. "Nature based" and "Waldorf" were clear describers in almost every conversation I had with them. They were so invested in their vision of the school that they insisted on designing the logo and renaming the school. Because the color scheme and font was foundational to the website navigation system, I was tasked in creating a color palettes and font usage that reflected the schools brand. The challenge was doing this before the logo or name of the school was established.</p>

                    <p>TYPOGRAPHY<br> From my conversations with the new administrator, I knew that the Germanic, wood block type fonts used in many “Waldorf” schools was something to avoid. The intention was to bring something natural, modern and open to the homeschooling movement. I immediately began looking to san serif fonts to reflect this modern educational ethos. Early in my research the Open Sans font became the obvious choice for the school. It was open and easy to read font that seemed to reflect the lyrical praise every stakeholder had for the school.</p>

                    <p>COLOR PALETTE<br> I began with a mood board to compile the examples and key word images that had been discussed by the client. Ultimately, I came up with three-color palates examples that had the proper contrast and readability for the navigation and met with the client’s approval. .

                    <p>With a concise site map, I went to work on building three low-fi wireframes. Before diving in, I researched common UI pattern and noted the nomenclature and navigation hierarchy on private school websites. I noted the kind and relative priorities of the information and functionality displayed. I also compiled a list of rules for displaying this information and the effect of different scenarios on this display.</p>

                    <p>When things are under a tight deadline so often the research phase of a project is often where clients will push to cut corners. I believe this tendency is born out of a client’s laser like focus on brand story and content, which eclipses the marketing and user experience context of their product. This project bears testament to this tendency and is reflected in the challenges of defining project scope and a clear site map. It is precisely this translation of idea into outline that a UX designer is hired. </p>

                    <p>Being a parent to young children is an exhausting and isolating endeavor. Finding a fun child focused activity is only a web search away. But how do you find recommended local kid friendly event and venues? The challenge is more than finding a destination it’s about answering parenting questions;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Do they have changing tables? </li>
                        <li> Is the performance during nap-time?</li>
                        <li>Can I use my stroller?</li>
                        <li>Is there shade? </li>
                        <li>Is there healthy food and drinks available?</li>
                    </ul>
                    The best resources for answering these questions is the collective intelligence of parents in the same situation. An easy to use mobile app is needed that connects parents in their search for today's kid friendly event and venues.

                    <p> SURVEY<br> I created a survey asking caregivers about the methods and resources they use to find local kid friendly events. I posted a link to the survey on a mother club online discussion forum and received 19 respondents. I also interviewed five survey respondents to clarify their answers and outlined their pain points when looking for kid friendly events.</p>


                    <p>PERSONA<br> I conducted five impromptu interviews of caregivers at two local park playgrounds. I asked them about what resources they used to find local kid friendly events. I was shocked to discover that these caregivers relied on the bulletin board at a nearby cafés and the fellow playground caregivers for finding recommended local events. In addition, I also closely reviewed the survey respondent data, followed the Southern Marin Mothers list serve for a week and generally explored online parenting blogs. From this research, I created four user personas.</p>

From my survey data, interviews with parents and resource landscape examination, I created a basic SWOT analysis. My take away from my research was that people want context and personal connections from their content, especially recommendations and real-time feedback. </p>

It was during this process that I made a fatal flaw and overlooked my user research.

                    <p>To design the dashboard, I did some UI pattern research and mapped out the sign-up and search flows using my user story as a guide. Then, I built the site map to help clarify the navigation structure and content hierarchy.</p>

                    <p>LOGO<br> First I made a list of words that described the app and then circled the top three. They were kids, fun, and movement. Then I searched for imagery around places where kids activities typically happen like playgrounds, circus tents, etc. This was good start but when creating a brand I often work a Socratic method to clarify the foundational elements behind the brand story. </p>

                    <p>Here is what a working Q and A looked like: </p>


                    <p>Q: What is this apps primary function? <br> A: Discovery of new, entertaining events to take my children too. From this answer I derived the tagline: “Let’s find some fun!” </p>

                    <p>Q: What is fun for both kids and parents? <br> A: Play</p>

                    <p>Q: Where do most children find play?<br> A: At a playground.</p>
                    <p>
                        Q: What is foundational for discovering new places?<br> A: Movement </p>

                    <p>Q: What playground activity is iconic for movement? <br> A:The Merry- Go - Round and Swings </p>
                    <p>
                        So the Merry–Go–Round became the name and brand icon because it signified both movement and play. Then, I shorted name to Merry-Go to further emphasize fun and movement.</p>


                    <p>COLORS<br> Searching key color indicators like fun, kids, vibrant, and feminine I found mostly cliché pinks, baby blues and lemon yellows that were either too pastel or over the top neon. I was looking for a more nuanced storyline for the Merry- Go color palate. Then I found these retro circus colors that contained the energetic fire engine reds that said “this is fun” to both adult and child.</p>

                    <p>TYPOGRAPHY<br> Appealing or a modern female demographic, I looked for a energetic and charming font that said fun. I found these qualities in the font Bree Serif for the logo. For heading and the body copy I looked for something open, easily readable and san serif. I arrived at the tall and thin Poppins Light for headings and the ubiquitous Roboto for the body copy.

                <p>Ok, I am a generalist I admit it. I like to wear lots of hats.</p>
                <p>As a Waldorf teacher I taught language arts, math, history, art, science, woodshop, technology, geography, movement, drama & science , so there’s that. </p>
                <p>Prior to teaching, I was a graphic designer for ten years. Behind the screen, I learned the dark arts of marketing and stories of the brand. Yet my fascination with people, cognitive studies and a desire for a better world brought me to teaching and ironically has brought me full circle to UX design. Home at last! </p>

                <p>Today, I have just begun my UX design career. I come with a deep set of soft skills developed as an educator, paired with ten-year experience as a graphic designer in marketing and brand strategy, So take a look at my work, and let me know if you like what you see. </p>
